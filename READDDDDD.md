Project: Predicting who survived titanic using ML

Note:
1. We are going to use random forests to implement this, because iss se accuracy is going to be high, andazan 80-82%.
Coding it will be tough thora sa, so use gpt wherever you can.
2. To make it easier, I talked to sir, he said pehle make decision tree, then extend it to random forests
3. In the cleaned test and training set, I decided not to drop the Cabin column even though they mostly had null values in the original set. Instead, I filled blank values with 'U', and changed cabin names with their first letter. So C45 becomes C, A34 becomes A etc etc. Keep that in mind because gpt could tell you to drop the column.

Iss ke ilawa kuch decide krna ho toh krlege, like splitting test and training set. Use gpt where u can, but try to do it khud se, learning achi wali hogi Inshallah.
